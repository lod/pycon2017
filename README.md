# Talk: Rapid GUI Development for IOT Systems

Slides and a link to the source code used in my pycon2017 talk.

Slides are created using reveal.js

## Code

The code directory contains snippets of code used in the presentation.
Some of it may not compile, that is not its intended purpose.

The actual operating source code used in the live demos is in the
https://github.com/lod/pycon2017-source-code repository, linked
from here as source-code.
